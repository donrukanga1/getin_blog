The GetIN App utilises modules of the Community Health Worker and Midwife (Facility Health Worker) Module to regiser and track attenantal attendace of young pregnant girls.
GetIN Functionality is based on the  role of each health worker and entry is granted after login into the system.

# Community Health Worker (VHT) module.

The community Health worker is assigned to a midwife under the Uganda  Ministry of Health working structure. He maps the girl in the community and the supervising midwife gets a copy of this information.
A strong network connection is neccesary to capture and move the information to the midwife. Getin allows for offline Data Caching to enable syncing data when a strong connection is available.
